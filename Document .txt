Task 1: Creating a Neural Network

Capabilities of the Code:
The code creates and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
It uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network.
The model is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64.
The code also saves the trained model for future use.

Installation and Usage:
Ensure that TensorFlow and Matplotlib are installed.
After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy and loss metrics are printed.
The trained model is saved as 'mnist_classifier_model.h5' for future use.





Task 2: Working with Databases

Capabilities of the Code:
The code connects to an SQLite database.An example usage section demonstrates how to add users, retrieve all users, update a user's age, and delete a user.

Installation and Usage:
Ensure that SQLite is installed, and the necessary Python SQLite library is available.
Execute the code in a Python environment.
Functions like add_user, retrieve_users, update_user, and delete_user can be used for interacting with the database.





Task 3: Integration with a Google API (Google Sheets)

Capabilities of the Code:
The code integrates with the Google Sheets API using the gspread library.
It authenticates the user, accesses a Google Sheets document by key, and retrieves all values from the first sheet.
The retrieved values are printed as a list of rows.

Installation and Usage:
Ensure that the necessary libraries like google.colab, gspread, and google.auth are installed.
Authentication is required, and the user needs to have the necessary permissions to access the Google Sheets document.
